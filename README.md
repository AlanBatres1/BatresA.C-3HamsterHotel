### Description: 
- Made a responsively designed website based on a [prototype mockup](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/3e3b745f-aa5a-460e-5fd7-8cc90c248d21-480a/screen/2bce9ed2-c1ed-4a71-ae23-37c1e019d677/Web-1920-1/) using bootstrap.

> Comments: The overall the desktop version is somewhat accurate. The site isn't very reponsive when shrunk manually. However at the tablet breakpoint it looks decent. A big issue here was hard coding. Try to use percentages as well as the container-row-col structure in bootstrap. Also consider making layout changes as things shrink down. There appeared to be an attempt to do that with the forms section, but it needs more work.
